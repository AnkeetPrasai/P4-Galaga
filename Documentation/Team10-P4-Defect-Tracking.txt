Defects:

1. Problem with getting initals to be stored and saved on scoreboard
   - Reported by Alex on 4/21
   - Fixed by Brandon on 4/23
   - Initials were not being stored properly in the text file so the leaderboard did not have the proper letters next to the number. It was fixed by adding in a variable loop that wouldn't increment until the user inputted in a letter so it wouldn't just zoom by with random characters.
   
2. Player would instantly lose if they didn't move at the start
  - Reported by Alex on 4/4
  - Fixed by Tom on 4/23
  - The first enemy would go along a path that made them instantly hit the player in their starting position. It was fixed by adding more randomness to the enemies to allow more variable change with their movement.
  
3. Values were not properly sorted on leaderboard correctly
   - Reported by Brandon on 4/19
   - Fixed by Brandon on 4/20
   - The value that the player got would take up every spot on the leaderboard if they beat the top spot instead of everything just moving down one. It was fixed by just checking if the player beat the bottom score and then sorting the values into descending order once the value was added to the array.
   
4. Font for level displays wouldn't display letters
   -Reported by Brandon on 4/15
   -Fixed by Brandon on 4/15
   - The text wouldn't write letters onto the screen generated by SFML. Turns out the font we were using didn't have letters loaded for some reason so we changed to a different font with letters.
   
5. Level 2 wouldn't loop back around to the start of the game
   - Repoted by Brandon on 4/15
   - Fixed by Brandon on 4/15
   - After completeing level 2 like the previous level, it wasn't looping back to the start properly so you couldn't instantly start a new level. Fixed by changing the return on the second level function to allow a certain return.
