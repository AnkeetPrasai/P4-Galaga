Initial Estimate of Project 4:

(35 hours) by our 4 team members (est. 8.75 hours per person) as well as 2 meetings that last 1 hr throughout the project (8 hours total)
(35 + 8 = 43 total hours) needed to accomplish a significant amount of goals:

Creating a new repository and getting git set up on all of our devices, finding out a method of communication for our group, meeting
to discuss where we are at in progression on the project, revising the classes we have for this project (Galaga, player, enemy, etc) to handle
our new features, creating new documentation both on the header files and making the new html file, filling out our personal hours documentation,
and filling out all of the essays required. We have to create additional logic for the game such as a scoring system that actually updates to a score
screen in which the user can add information and compare their scores to others for Galaga.

We also will be creating a test suite and video presentation in order to show off our project and show that the individual features of it work effectively.

Extra hours also included for anticipated confusion on the project as well as checking and preparing our project for submission and the demo. 

We anticipate doing all of this will take roughly 10.75 hours a person to be safe as a lot of code and planning has to be done for
this project.

Final Hours of Project 4 (43 hours):

This project, we somehow managed to take as long as we expected. We achieved all things we set out to conqueor.
