Initial Estimate of Project 3:

(55 hours) by our 4 team members (est. 13.75 hours per person) as well as  meetings that last  hr throughout the project (2 hours total)
(55 + 8 = 63 total hours) needed to accomplish a significant amount of goals:

Creating a new repository and getting git set up on all of our devices, finding out a method of communication for our group, meeting
to discuss where we are at in progression on the project, creating the new classes we 
have for this project (Galaga, player, enemy, etc), creating new documentation both on the header files and making the new html file, filling out
our personal hours documentation, and filling out all of the essays required. We have to create the logic for the game, movement patterns, and
scoring system for Galaga.

Extra hours also included for anticipated confusion on the project as well as checking and preparing our project for submission and the demo. 

We anticipate doing all of this will take roughly 15.75 hours a person to be safe as a lot of code and planning has to be done for
this project.


Final Hours of Project 3 (51.75 hours):

The project took a shorter amount of time than we expected but we ran into a lot of issues figuring out how to implement SMFL in general.
